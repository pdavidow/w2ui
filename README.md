# w2ui
Meteor + W2ui

Shows ability to hook up Meteor with W2ui (http://w2ui.com/web/home).  Uses W2ui branch destined for 1.4.3

Assumes 1:1:1 for Collection:Class:Schema.

The top grid uses multi-record save for (double-click) inline-edits, and is in decent shape.
The bottom grid is single-record oriented, with unpolished interface. Note that for fields to be designated as changed 
(little red triangle in field upper right), the user sometimes has to click around -- especially with the color picker.
